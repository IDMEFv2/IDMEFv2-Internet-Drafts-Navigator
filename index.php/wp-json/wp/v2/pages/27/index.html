But this exhaustivity can be seen as a weakness.

The storage or the human notification has not been enough treated and present implementation difficulties.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>RFC 4767 (transport) is based on the BEEP protocol which has never really been deployed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>IDMEFv1 is very &#8220;XML dependent&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2020 &#8211; 2023 SECEF2 : IDMEFV2 standardization<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>2020 SECEF2 : IDMEFV2 new version and standardization goal<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020 the SECEF2 (SECurity Exchange Format) consortium was created to create a new version of the format and standardize it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SECEF2 consortium is an enlargement of the SECEF1 consortium with new industrial members.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step of the project was to experiment a new version of IDMEFv2 for protection of combined and complex threat on cyber and physical infrastructures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This experimentation has been done on real scale in five different prototypes in the H2020 7SHIELD research project<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The major results and decisions for IDMEFv2 were:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li> favor simplicity over exhaustivity<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li> work on end-to-end messages, from the sensor to the operator<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li> enlarge the use of IDMEF to incident not only intrusion<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li> ability to treat any kind of incident may they be cyber or physical<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li> JSON will be the preferred format and HTTPs will be the preferred transport<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li> limited number of classes (less than 10), attributes and depth<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>IDMEFv2 draft is also based on some ideas and concepts of the IDEA (Intrusion Detection Extensible Alert) format (which is also based on IDMEFv1)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1998 &#8211; 2007 : IDMEFv1 During nearly ten years, the Intrusion Detection Working Group worked on the definition of the IDMEF format.
